# ========================================
# Python Runtime
# ========================================
# Why: Bytecode and cache files are generated at runtime.
# Committing them causes merge conflicts and bloats repo.

*.py[cod]
*$py.class

# ========================================
# Environment & Secrets
# ========================================
# Why: API keys, local config should NEVER be committed.
# Each developer/environment has unique credentials.

# ========================================
# Operating System
# ========================================
# Why: macOS/Windows metadata files are irrelevant to the project.
# Committing them signals poor git hygiene.
.DS_Store

# ========================================
# IDE / Editor
# ========================================
# Why: Developer-specific IDE settings should not be shared.
# Use .editorconfig or README for shared conventions.

# Application Logs
# ========================================
# Why: Logs contain runtime-specific data and grow unbounded.
# Developers can generate their own during testing.

# Data - Raw Review Batches
# ========================================
# Why: Daily review JSON files can be large and contain user data.
# Mock data can be regenerated via ingestion agent.
# Exception: Keep .gitkeep to preserve directory structure.
data/raw/*.json
!data/raw/.gitkeep

# ========================================
# Data - Daily Topic Counts
# ========================================
# Why: These are intermediate computation results.
# Can be regenerated by running the pipeline.
data/daily_counts/*.json
!data/daily_counts/.gitkeep

# ========================================
# Data - Topic Registry
# ========================================
# Why: Registry evolves during pipeline runs.
# Start with empty registry; let reviewers see initial state.
# If you want to commit a sample registry, unignore this line.
# data/topic_registry.json

# ========================================
# Output - Trend Tables (KEEP FOR REVIEW)
# ========================================
# Why: Sample outputs demonstrate the pipeline works.
# Reviewers NEED to see example trend_*.csv files.
# Therefore, output/ is NOT ignored.
# If output grows too large, selectively ignore:
# output/*.csv
# !output/trend_2024-07-01.csv  # Keep one sample
